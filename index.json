[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I am a Doctoral Assistant at the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) pursuing my PhD in the Program for Robotics, Control and Intelligent Systems (EDRS), supervised by Prof. Francesco Mondada in the Mobots group.\nMy current work focuses on disentangling the social interactions of shoals of fish by leveraging machine learning models which will ultimately allow for real-time interactions with an in-house robotic fish. This work is funded by the EPFL and the SNSF\n    Undergraduate studies  I hold a Dipl. Eng. degree from the Computer Engineering \u0026amp; Informatics Department (CEID) which belongs Polytechnic school of the University of Patras, Greece that was awarded to me in November 2017. I completed my thesis one year earlier in Inria Nancy Grand-Est in France under the joint supervision of Prof. Ioannis Hatzilygeroudis from CEID and Dr. Jean-Baptiste Mouret from Inria. My thesis was entitled \u0026ldquo;Robot damage recovery with safety constraints\u0026rdquo; (see related publication here). Throughout this period, I had the chance to work alongside some excellent researchers of Inria\u0026rsquo;s Larsen team that I consider to have contributed towards the completion of my thesis, namely; Dr. Konstantinos Chatzilygeroudis and Dr. Vassilis Vassiliades.\nThe thesis was funded by the ERC \u0026ldquo;Resibots\u0026rdquo; project.\n      ","date":1620691200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1620691200,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"I am a Doctoral Assistant at the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) pursuing my PhD in the Program for Robotics, Control and Intelligent Systems (EDRS), supervised by Prof. Francesco Mondada in the Mobots group.","tags":null,"title":"Vaios Papaspyros","type":"authors"},{"authors":["Laila El-Hamamsy","Vaios Papaspyros","Taavet Kangur","Lausra Mathex","Christian Giang,  and Melissa Skweres,  and Barbara Bruno,  and Mondada, Francesco","Francesco Mondada"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1620691200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1620691200,"objectID":"7d5cf5a62142c97adf3b39fe0f96310a","permalink":"https://bpapaspyros.github.io/publication/rie_2021/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rie_2021/","section":"publication","summary":" ","tags":[],"title":"Exploring a Handwriting Programming Language for Educational Robots","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ramon Escobedo","Valentin Lecheval","Vaios Papaspyros","Frank Bonnet","Francesco Mondada","Clement Sire","Guy Theraulaz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1600041600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600041600,"objectID":"d6b1403b6ba6fb71179e6dc48c048951","permalink":"https://bpapaspyros.github.io/publication/philosophical_2020/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/philosophical_2020/","section":"publication","summary":" ","tags":[],"title":"A data-driven method for reconstructing and modelling social interactions in moving animal groups","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vaios Papaspyros","Frank Bonnet","Bertrand Collignon","Francesco Mondada"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1566259200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566259200,"objectID":"f259d508092260cbe7e061f02b4b8c6f","permalink":"https://bpapaspyros.github.io/publication/plos_2019/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/plos_2019/","section":"publication","summary":" ","tags":[],"title":"Bidirectional interactions facilitate the integration of a robot into a shoal of zebrafish Danio rerio","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vaios Papaspyros","Konstantinos Chatzilygeroudis","Vassilis Vassiliades","Jean-Baptiste Mouret"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1481328000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1481328000,"objectID":"40b76a596e58bc3df2ab42b6fe32888d","permalink":"https://bpapaspyros.github.io/publication/nips_2016/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nips_2016/","section":"publication","summary":" ","tags":[],"title":"Safety-aware robot damage recovery using constrained bayesian optimization and simulated priors","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://bpapaspyros.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
